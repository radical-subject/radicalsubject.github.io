Hi!

I'm a chemist and `leading research associate` in small but proud pharmaceutical company. 
Computer sciences are my passion, though IT is not really connected with my work. 
Previously i started to apply my coding skills to chemoinformatics, ML applications in chemistry, docking and quantum mechanical calculations, so i hope for some convergence of my skils in all of my expertise areas.
