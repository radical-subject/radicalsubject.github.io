Hello!

I'm `PhD in organic chemistry` and work as `leading research associate` in Moscow-based full cycle pharmaceutical company `Pharm-Sintez`. 


Computer sciences are my passion, though IT is not really connected with my work. 
Previously i started to apply my coding skills to `chemoinformatics`, `ML` applications in chemistry, `docking` and `quantum mechanical calculations`, so i hope for some convergence of my skils in all of my expertise areas.


I also like extreme sports and music.
Check out or trip to Iran in 2015-2016:
