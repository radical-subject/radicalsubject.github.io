Hi \0

On the internet I'm mostly known as \[Maybe\] Waffle \[Lapkin\]. 
I'm fine with most pronouns, though I'm used to he/him. 

I'm `rust` evangelist and the best desktop app \[citation needed\]. 
I mostly write smol rust libraries, though I also maintain [`teloxide`] and sometimes contribute to [`rust-lang/rust`].

[`rust-lang/rust`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust
[`teloxide`]: https://github.com/teloxide

I also like taking photographs, mostly of plants and sunsets.

      alt="A dark photo of a money tree (also kmown as Crassula ovata). The background is very blurry.", 
      style="border-radius: 8px; width: 80%;"
  )
}}
