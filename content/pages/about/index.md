Hi!

I'm a chemist and `leading research associate` in small but proud pharmaceutical company. 
Computer sciences are my passion, though IT is not really connected with my work. 
Previously i started to apply my coding skills to chemoinformatics, ML applications in chemistry, docking and quantum mechanical calculations, so i hope for some convergence of my skils in all of my expertise areas.


I also like extreme sports and music.\n
Time management is done by Liubischev system.\n 
Knowledge base is maintained by Zettelkasten method in great [obsidian.md]
