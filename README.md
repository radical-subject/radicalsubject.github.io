This is [my] blog. 
It originated as a [telegram channel], however telegram is terrible for writing long posts, so I've made this blog.
You can read more about me on the [`/about`] page.

## Technical details

The site is built using [Zola] and is hosted using github pages. The theme is [`terminimal`], though I plan to patch it.

## loathe? hate?

`ihatereality` nickname was already [taken]. Even though it seems it was never actually used, github doesn't allow reclaiming nicknames [anymore].
